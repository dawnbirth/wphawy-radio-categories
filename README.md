Wphawy radio categories
=======================

A wordpress plugin that forces the user to assign the post to one category only.
This plugin will remove the default categories metabox and replace it with a new one with radio buttons.

Note
====
This plugin depends on the Idea of the tutorial "How to Use Radio Buttons With Taxonomies" on wp.tutsplus.com.
